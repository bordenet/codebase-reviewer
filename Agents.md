## Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

Before ANY commit:
1. **Lint**: `npm run lint`
2. **Build**: `npm run build`
3. **Test**: `npm test`
4. **Coverage**: Minimum 70%

**Order matters.** Lint → Build → Test. Never skip steps.

---

## Communication Rules

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "seamless"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

**Banned phrases**: production-grade, world-class, leverage, utilize, incredibly, extremely, Happy to help!

---

## 🚨 Progressive Module Loading

**STOP and load the relevant module BEFORE these actions:**

### Language Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE writing ANY `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` file**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/languages/javascript.md`

### Workflow Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE any commit, PR, push, or merge**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/security.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN tests fail OR after 2+ failed fix attempts**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/testing.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN build fails OR lint errors appear**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/build-hygiene.md`
- 🟡 **BEFORE deploying to any environment**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/deployment.md`
- 🟡 **WHEN conversation exceeds 50 exchanges**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/context-management.md`

### Optional: Superpowers integration

If [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is installed, run at session start:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

## Superpowers Bootstrap

At the START of every conversation, run:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

**Key skills to invoke:**
| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `superpowers:brainstorming` | Before creative/feature work |
| `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | Before fixing bugs |
| `superpowers:test-driven-development` | Before writing implementation |
| `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | Before claiming done |

---

## Communication Standards

### Banned Phrases
| AI Tells | leverage, utilize, facilitate, streamline, optimize |
| Filler | It's important to note, It's worth mentioning, Interestingly |
| Sycophancy | Great question!, Happy to help!, Excellent point! |

### Evidence-Based Claims
Every claim requires evidence. No unsubstantiated assertions.

---

## Quality Gates

**Before ANY commit:**
```bash
golangci-lint run ./...
go test ./... -race -coverprofile=coverage.out
go build ./...
```

---

## Context Management

- **Context rot**: Model accuracy degrades as context fills. Keep tokens high-signal.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load Agents.md always, modules on-demand, code just-in-time.
- **At 75% context**: Summarize conversation history, drop low-value context.
- **Session resumption**: Check `git status`, `git log -5`, load notes before proceeding.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

# Claude Code Guidelines for This Repository

This document contains project-specific guidelines and lessons learned for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## 🔄 **SESSION RESUMPTION - READ THIS FIRST**

### **CRITICAL: Always Check Resumption State on New Session**

**BEFORE doing anything else in a new conversation/session:**

1. ✅ **ALWAYS read `.resumption_state.md` in the repository root**
2. ✅ Check the current sprint, task state, and exact next steps
3. ✅ Review what NOT to do (avoid recreating working code)
4. ✅ Continue from the exact checkpoint

**BEFORE ending a conversation/session:**

1. ✅ **ALWAYS update `.resumption_state.md`** with current state
2. ✅ Document exactly what's completed, what's in progress, what's broken
3. ✅ List the exact next steps for resumption
4. ✅ Include critical commands for testing/validation
5. ✅ Note any files that should NOT be modified

**The `.resumption_state.md` file is the source of truth for work continuity.**

## Project Overview

**Codebase Reviewer** is a Python-based tool for analyzing codebases and generating AI review prompts.

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Framework**: Flask (web interface)
- **Package Manager**: pip + virtualenv
- **Code Quality**: pylint, mypy, black, pytest
- **Installation**: Development mode (`pip install -e .`)

## User Environment

- **All hardware is Apple Silicon** (ARM64 architecture)
- Homebrew paths: `/opt/homebrew/` (not `/usr/local/`)
- When suggesting paths, always use Apple Silicon defaults first
- **macOS uses BSD tools, not GNU** - always test awk/sed/grep syntax in bash scripts
  - BSD awk does NOT support `match()` with array capture
  - Use `grep | sed` pipelines instead of complex awk
  - Test all regex/text processing commands before committing

## 🔒 **CRITICAL: Pre-Commit Hooks - NEVER BYPASS**

### ⚠️ **ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER BYPASS PRE-COMMIT HOOKS**

This repository has **IP protection pre-commit hooks** that prevent leaking proprietary codebase data.

**NEVER, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES:**
- Use `git commit --no-verify`
- Use `git commit -n`
- Bypass pre-commit hooks in any way
- Suggest bypassing hooks to the user
- Force-add files that are blocked by hooks without fixing the issue

**If a commit is blocked:**
1. ✅ Read the error message carefully
2. ✅ Remove sensitive references (e.g., proprietary company names, internal paths)
3. ✅ Use generic examples instead
4. ✅ Re-stage and commit normally
5. ❌ NEVER suggest `--no-verify`

**The pre-commit hook protects against:**
- Analysis output files in `/tmp/codebase-reviewer/`
- References to analyzed repository names
- Proprietary file paths
- Sensitive data in file contents

**This is a SECURITY REQUIREMENT, not a suggestion.**

## Quality Standards for Code Delivery

### ALWAYS Do Before Claiming "Done":

1. **Lint the code**
   - Run `pylint src/codebase_reviewer` (target: 9.5+/10)
   - Run `mypy src/codebase_reviewer` for type checking
   - Run `black src/codebase_reviewer tests/` for formatting
   - Fix ALL warnings that aren't explicitly false positives
   - Don't wait to be asked

2. **Test the code**
   - **ALWAYS run `pytest tests/ -v` before committing**
   - Ensure all existing tests pass
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Don't commit broken code
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - If you can't test on the target platform, explicitly document this

3. **Handle edge cases**
   - Filenames with spaces/special characters
   - Empty inputs / None values
   - Missing files or directories
   - Invalid repository paths
   - Malformed documentation files

4. **Error handling**
   - Use proper exception handling (try/except)
   - Provide actionable error messages
   - Log errors comprehensively
   - Don't silently swallow exceptions
   - Return appropriate status codes

5. **Input validation**
   - Validate file paths exist before processing
   - Check for required fields in data structures
   - Sanitize user input (especially for web interface)
   - Use type hints for function parameters

### Python-Specific Standards:

1. **Type hints**: Use them consistently
   ```python
   # Good
   def analyze(repo_path: str) -> RepositoryAnalysis:
       ...
   ```

2. **Docstrings**: Use for all public functions/classes
   ```python
   """Analyze a codebase and generate review prompts.

   Args:
       repo_path: Absolute path to repository

   Returns:
       RepositoryAnalysis object with findings
   """
   ```

3. **Imports**: Organize properly
   - Standard library first
   - Third-party packages second
   - Local imports last
   - Remove unused imports

4. **Code formatting**: Follow black style
   - Max line length: 120 (per project convention)
   - Use double quotes for strings
   - 4 spaces for indentation

### Before Creating a PR:

1. **All tests pass**: `pytest tests/ -v`
2. **Code is formatted**: `black src/codebase_reviewer tests/`
3. **Linting passes**: `pylint src/codebase_reviewer` (9.5+/10)
4. **Type checking passes**: `mypy src/codebase_reviewer`
5. **Pre-commit hooks pass** (automatically enforced)
6. Edge cases considered and documented
7. Error handling tested where possible
8. Code follows project conventions
9. Commit messages are descriptive

**Don't make the user ask for basic quality practices.**

### Creating Pull Requests:

**ALWAYS provide a PR URL when changes are ready for review.**

When in Web mode (where `gh` CLI is unavailable):
1. Provide the direct GitHub compare URL for PR creation
2. Format: `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/compare/BASE...BRANCH?expand=1`
3. Include pre-written title and description for user to paste
4. Don't leave the user hunting for how to create the PR

Example:
```
https://github.com/matt/codebase-reviewer/compare/main...feature-branch?expand=1
```

## Shell Script Standards

**CRITICAL**: This repository MUST be friction-free for adopters. If setup is painful, the repo is worthless.

### Philosophy:

We ALWAYS rely on high-quality shell scripts to:
1. **Install dependencies** (`scripts/setup-*.sh`)
2. **Run the application** (`start-web.sh`, `setup.sh`)

### Shell Script Requirements:

Every shell script MUST:

1. **Be self-contained and robust**
   - Kill abandoned sessions tying up ports
   - Set up virtual environments automatically
   - Install dependencies without user intervention
   - Handle errors gracefully with clear messages
   - Provide colored, informative output

2. **Follow our style guide**
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   set -euo pipefail  # Fail fast, catch errors

   # Colors for output
   RED='\033[0;31m'
   GREEN='\033[0;32m'
   YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
   BLUE='\033[0;34m'
   NC='\033[0m' # No Color

   log_info() { echo -e "${BLUE}ℹ${NC} $*"; }
   log_success() { echo -e "${GREEN}✓${NC} $*"; }
   log_warning() { echo -e "${YELLOW}⚠${NC} $*"; }
   log_error() { echo -e "${RED}✗${NC} $*" >&2; }
   ```

3. **Handle port conflicts intelligently**
   - Check if port is in use
   - Kill stale processes (with user awareness)
   - Find alternative ports automatically
   - Use sensible defaults (avoid system ports like 5000 on macOS)

4. **Provide excellent UX**
   - Clear progress indicators
   - Helpful error messages
   - Show URLs where services are running
   - Explain what's happening at each step

5. **Be macOS-aware**
   - Use BSD-compatible commands (not GNU)
   - Handle Apple Silicon paths (`/opt/homebrew/`)
   - Avoid ports used by macOS services (5000 = AirPlay)
   - Test with `lsof` for port checking

### Example: Running the Web App

The `start-web.sh` script MUST:
1. ✅ Set up the virtual environment
2. ✅ Kill old abandoned sessions on the target port
3. ✅ Build/install the app
4. ✅ Start the server on an available port
5. ✅ Open the web browser automatically
6. ✅ Provide clear instructions for stopping

**One command to rule them all:**
```bash
./start-web.sh
```

No manual venv activation. No port conflicts. No confusion. Just works.

## Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to enforce quality standards. All commits must pass:

1. **Black formatting** - Auto-formats code
2. **PyLint** - Linting checks (9.5+/10 required)
3. **Pytest** - All tests must pass (50%+ coverage required)
4. **MyPy** - Type checking

The hooks run automatically on `git commit`. If they fail, the commit is blocked.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: CLI Integration Testing - QUALITY GATE**

### **The Incident That Must Never Repeat**

On 2025-11-26, we had a critical quality gate failure:
- All 177 unit tests passed ✅
- The CLI was completely broken due to import errors ❌
- CI passed, code was pushed to main
- The tool was unusable - broken imports in `cli/enterprise.py`
- Senior stakeholders saw a broken repository

**Root Cause**: Unit tests tested individual modules but never tested whether the CLI could actually start.

### **MANDATORY: CLI Integration Tests**

The file `tests/test_cli_integration.py` exists to prevent this. It tests:

1. **All CLI module imports work** - Tests that all `cli/*.py` files can be imported
2. **CLI starts successfully** - Tests that `review-codebase --help` works
3. **All commands are accessible** - Tests that each command's `--help` works
4. **Subprocess verification** - Tests the CLI via subprocess (like a real user)

### **NEVER Do This:**

❌ Refactor CLI imports without running `tests/test_cli_integration.py`
❌ Add new CLI commands without adding integration tests
❌ Assume unit tests passing means the CLI works
❌ Push to main without verifying `review-codebase --help` works

### **ALWAYS Do This:**

✅ Run `review-codebase --help` locally before pushing
✅ Run `pytest tests/test_cli_integration.py -v` after any CLI changes
✅ Add integration tests for new CLI commands
✅ Test each CLI command's `--help` after refactoring

### **The Golden Rule:**

**If you refactor imports or module structure, the CLI integration tests MUST pass.**

```bash
# After any CLI or import changes:
pytest tests/test_cli_integration.py -v
review-codebase --help
```

This is not optional. This is a hard requirement.

## Communication Standards

### Language and Tone

**NEVER use hype, inflated, or naive language:**

❌ **AVOID:**
- "PRODUCTION-READY!"
- "AMAZING!"
- "PERFECT!"
- "REVOLUTIONARY!"
- "GAME-CHANGING!"
- "INCREDIBLE!"
- Over-inflated claims
- Excessive exclamation marks
- Marketing speak
- Junior engineer enthusiasm

✅ **USE:**
- "Complete" or "Functional"
- "Working" or "Tested"
- "Validated" or "Verified"
- Factual, measured language
- Humble, professional tone
- High standards without hype

**Rationale**: Lofty, over-inflated language smacks of junior engineer naivety and low standards. Stay humble. Maintain a supremely high bar. Let the work speak for itself.

**Examples:**

❌ Bad: "This is PRODUCTION-READY and AMAZING!"
✅ Good: "This is complete and has been tested against the requirements."

❌ Bad: "PERFECT! Everything works FLAWLESSLY!"
✅ Good: "All tests pass. The implementation meets the specified requirements."

❌ Bad: "This REVOLUTIONARY feature will CHANGE EVERYTHING!"
✅ Good: "This feature addresses the identified gap in functionality."
