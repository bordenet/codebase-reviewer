    title: "Security Vulnerability Assessment"
    objective: "Identify potential security vulnerabilities and unsafe practices in the codebase"
    tasks:
      - "Scan for common security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)"
      - "Check for hardcoded credentials, API keys, or sensitive data"
      - "Review authentication and authorization mechanisms"
      - "Identify insecure cryptographic practices"
      - "Check for unsafe deserialization or eval() usage"
      - "Review file upload/download security"
      - "Assess input validation and sanitization"
      - "Check for security headers and CORS configuration"
