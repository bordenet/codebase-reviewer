# Phase 1: Architecture Analysis Prompt Templates
# These templates define prompts for validating documented architecture against actual code

    title: "Validate Documented Architecture Against Actual Code"
    objective: "Verify if actual code structure matches documented architecture claims"
    tasks:
      - "Compare claimed architectural pattern vs actual implementation"
      - "Verify documented modules/layers exist in code"
      - "Check if technology stack matches documentation"
      - "Identify undocumented components or services"
      - "Flag any significant documentation inaccuracies"
      - "Assess overall architecture quality and appropriateness"

      **Architecture Validation Report**

      ## Claimed vs. Actual Architecture
      - **Claimed Pattern**: [e.g., microservices, monolith, layered]
      - **Actual Pattern**: [What the code actually implements]
      - **Match Status**: ✅ Match / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Mismatch

      ## Component Validation
      For each claimed component:
      - **Component Name**: [From documentation]
      - **Status**: ✅ Found / ❌ Missing / ⚠️ Partial
      - **Location**: [Actual file/directory path]
      - **Discrepancies**: [Any differences from documentation]

      ## Technology Stack Validation
      - **Claimed Technologies**: [List from docs]
      - **Actual Technologies**: [List from code analysis]
      - **Missing**: [Technologies claimed but not found]
      - **Undocumented**: [Technologies used but not documented]

      ## Recommendations
      1. [Specific action items to align code and documentation]
      2. [Architecture improvements if needed]

      **Example:**
      ```
      ## Component Validation
      - **DocumentationAnalyzer**: ✅ Found at `src/analyzers/documentation.py`
      - **CacheLayer**: ❌ Missing (claimed in README but not implemented)
      - **APIGateway**: ⚠️ Partial (exists but uses Flask instead of documented FastAPI)
