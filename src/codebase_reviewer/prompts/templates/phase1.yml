# Phase 1: Architecture Analysis Prompt Templates
# These templates define prompts for validating documented architecture against actual code

prompts:

      - "Verify documented modules/layers exist in code"
      - "Check if technology stack matches documentation"
      - "Identify undocumented components or services"
      - "Flag any significant documentation inaccuracies"
      - "Assess overall architecture quality and appropriateness"
